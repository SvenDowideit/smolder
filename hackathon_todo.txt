Easy
========
1) Add screenshots to POD (Smolder.pm)
2) Move inline CSS to style sheets
3) Allow anonymous uploads via smolder_smoke_signal
4) Add good documentation for configuration
5) Change Build.PL so that only Smolder, Smolder::Manual, smolder, smolderctl and smolder_smoke_signal 
  are viewable in search.cpan.org
6) RT #52338 (log file getting truncated) http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=52338
7) RT #49993 (default port)


Medium
========
8) Get /static urls outputting better HTTP headers to improve browser caching
9) Handle SKIP ALL better (showing more information rather than just "No tests run"
10) Precompile all templates at startup (speeds it up and increases shared memory)
11) RT #49989 (JS error)
12) Change URLs so public and private projects are accessed over the same URL

Hard
========
13) Design Plugin Architecture
  + adding and overriding templates and htdocs
  + adding sql tables
  + adding code
14) Create a full search system of smoke reports, not just a listing
  by most recent. This would allow for searching based on project,
  status, category, etc
15) Import/Export of projects so you can move them around different Smolder installs
